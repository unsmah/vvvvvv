00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:08.132
Hi!

00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:09.023
I'm Ana.

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:10.906
Welcome to What to Say!

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:35.927
Do you know what to say when you talk about your personal interests?

00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:40.974
Listen out for useful language for talking about personal interests.

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:44.047
Then, we'll practise saying the new phrases –

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.515
after this.

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:48.336
Hi, Paul.

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:51.156
I made you a cup of tea.

00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:55.171
Just how you like it, milk and two sugars.

00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:56.945
Oh, thanks, Emir.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.015
You're welcome.

00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:08.144
So what do you do when you're not working?

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.229
Oh, umm,

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:10.542
not much.

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:14.080
I'm always really tired in the evenings and at weekends.

00:01:14.604 --> 00:01:16.471
Haven't you got any hobbies?

00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:20.637
Well, I've recently started doing meditation.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.957
I didn't know you did meditation. I do too!

00:01:24.153 --> 00:01:25.481
Oh, right.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:27.340
So, um,

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:29.512
how often do you practise?

00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:35.371
Most mornings usually, but if it's really busy, then sometimes it's hard to find time.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.195
Yeah, I know what you mean.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:40.213
I normally meditate once or twice a week.

00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:43.534
I never have enough time to do it more than that.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.474
What are you doing now?

00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:51.515
Nothing much, just drinking my tea …

00:02:16.923 --> 00:02:17.883
Hello again!

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:21.688
Now that's something you don't see in the office every day!

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:28.421
So, did you notice the useful phrases used for talking about your personal interests?

00:02:28.742 --> 00:02:30.906
Listen to me and then repeat.

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.593
What do you do when you're not working?

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.858
What do you do when you're not working?

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:45.644
I didn't know you did meditation.

00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:52.097
I didn't know you did meditation.

00:02:56.487 --> 00:02:57.619
I do too!

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.260
I do too!

00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:05.185
How often do you practise?

00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:09.779
How often do you practise?

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:14.264
Most mornings, usually.

00:03:17.278 --> 00:03:19.223
Most mornings, usually.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.778
Sometimes it's hard to find time.

00:03:28.284 --> 00:03:30.698
Sometimes it's hard to find time.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.213
I normally meditate once or twice a week.

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:45.098
I normally meditate once or twice a week.

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:50.938
I never have enough time.

00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:55.536
I never have enough time.

00:03:58.122 --> 00:04:03.812
Try and use some of these phrases the next time you talk about your personal interests in English.

00:04:04.164 --> 00:04:05.640
Bye for now!
