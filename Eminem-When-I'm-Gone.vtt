00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.700
Yo, it's my life, my own words I guess

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.500
Have you ever loved someone so much

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.800
You'd give an arm for

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.200
Not the expression, no

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.000
Literally give an arm for

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.300
When they know they're your heart

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.100
And you know you are their armor

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.300
And you will destroy anyone
who would try to harm her

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.800
But what happens when karma

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.400
Turns right around and bites you

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.800
And everything you stand for
turns on you to spite you

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.700
What happens when you become
the main source of her pain

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.300
"Daddy look what I made"

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.900
"Dad's gotta go catch a plane"

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.200
"Daddy where's mommy?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.300
I can't find mommy, where is she?"

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.600
"I don't know, go play, Hailie
baby, your daddy's busy

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.400
Daddy's writing a song, this
song ain't gon write itself"

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.600
I give you one underdog, and
you gotta swing by yourself

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.000
Then turn right around in that
song and tell her you love her

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.300
And put hands on her mother
who's the spittin' image of
her

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.500
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby
Slim Shady's crazy

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700
Shady made me

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.200
But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.200
And when I'm gone just carry
on don't mourn,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.800
Rejoice every time you hear
the sound of my voice, just
know that,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.600
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.100
And I didn't feel a thing so
baby, don't feel no pain, just
smile back

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.000
And when I'm gone just carry
on don't mourn,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.600
Rejoice every time you hear
the sound of my voice, just
know that,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.400
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.800
And I didn't feel a thing so
baby, don't feel no pain, just
smile back

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I keep havin' this dream,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.300
I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing,
she keeps screamin', she don't
want me to sing

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.800
"You're makin' mommy cry, why,
why is mommy cryin'"

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no
more, Daddy you're lyin'

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.500
You always say that, you
always say this is the last
time

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.600
But you ain't leavin' no more
daddy, you're mine"

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.700
She's pilin' boxes in front of
the door tryin' to block it

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.100
"Daddy please, daddy, don't
leave, daddy, no, stop it"

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.000
Goes in her pocket, pulls out
a tiny necklace locket

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.700
It's got a picture, "This will
keep you safe daddy, take it
with ya"

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.300
I look up, it's just me
standin' in the mirror

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.800
These fuckin' walls must be
talkin', 'cause man I can hear
'em

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.300
They're sayin', "you got one
more chance to do right

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.500
And it's tonight, now go out
and show em that you love 'em
before it's too late"

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.700
And just as I go to walk out
of my bedroom door

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.400
It turns to a stage, they're
gone and the spotlight is on
and I'm singin'

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.000
And when I'm gone just carry
on don't mourn,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.500
Rejoice every time you hear
the sound of my voice, just
know that,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.200
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.900
And I didn't feel a thing so
baby, don't feel no pain, just
smile back

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.700
And when I'm gone just carry
on don't mourn,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.300
Rejoice every time you hear
the sound of my voice, just
know that,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.100
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.600
And I didn't feel a thing so
baby, don't feel no pain, just
smile back

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.000
Sixty thousand people all
jumpin' out their seat

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.300
The curtain closes, they're
throwin' roses at my feet

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.400
I take a bow, and thank you
all for comin out

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.900
They're screamin' so loud, I
take one last look at the
crowd

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.900
I glance down, I don't believe
what I'm seein'

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.300
"Daddy, its me, help mommy,
her wrists are bleedin'"

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.800
But baby we're in Sweden

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.300
How did you get to Sweden?

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.900
"I followed you daddy

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.600
You told me that you weren't leavin'

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.700
You lied to me dad, and now
you made mommy sad

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.000
And I bought you this coin, it
says number one dad

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.100
That's all I wanted, I just
want to give you this coin"

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.600
"I get the point, fine, me and
mommy are goin'"

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.500
"But baby wait, it's too late
dad, you made your choice

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.900
Now go out there and show em
that you love em more than us

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.100
That's what they want

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.400
They want you, Marshall

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.000
They keep screamin' your name

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.000
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.200
Just take another pill, yeah I
bet you you will!

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.500
You rap about it, yeah word,
kid keep it real"

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.800
I hear a applause, all this
time I couldn't see

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.900
How could it be, that the
curtain is closin' on me

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.700
I turn around, find a gun on the ground

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.600
Cock it, put it to my brain,
scream Die Shady! And pop it

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.700
The sky darkens, my life flashes

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.900
The plane that I was supposed
to be on, crashes, and burns
to ashes

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.100
That's when I wake up

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.700
Alarm clock's ringing, there's
birds singin'

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.100
It's spring and Hailie's
outside swingin'

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.500
I walk right up to Kim and
kiss her tell her I miss her

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.000
Hailie just smiles and winks
at her little sister almost as
if to say

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.000
And when I'm gone just carry
on don't mourn,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.800
Rejoice every time you hear
the sound of my voice, just
know that,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.500
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.600
And I didn't feel a thing so
baby, don't feel no pain, just
smile back

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.800
And when I'm gone just carry
on don't mourn,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.600
Rejoice every time you hear
the sound of my voice, just
know that,

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.400
I'm lookin' down on you smilin'

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.600
And I didn't feel a thing so
baby, don't feel no pain, just
smile back

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:52.600
